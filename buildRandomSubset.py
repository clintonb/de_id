Creates a subset of the course/person dataset, replacing the student ID with a random
number between 1 and 10,000,000 but which is unique for each user and constant for the
same user, and replaces the name of the student with a randomly name chosen from a list
of the most common first and last names in the U.S. These names must be stored in
files named femaleNames.csv, maleNames.csv, and lastNames.csv in the directory in which
the program is run. The program takes the name of the file containing all of the 
course/person records and the name of the subset file to be generated as command
line arguments.
