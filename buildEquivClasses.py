"""
Find the distribution of equivalence class sizes for a dataset with a particular set of quasi-identifiers

This program will take a set of fields in each line (hard coded, at the moment) and will build a dictionary
that has as key the concatenation of those fields, with values the count of the number of records that
are in the equivalence class defined by those fields.

The program then runs over this dictionary and creates another, keyed by the number of entries in an
equivalence class, with values the number of different equivalence classes that have this number of
entries. This dictionary will then be printed out, with the keys sorted from lowest to highest.

The first part of the code is taken from testKAnon.py, written for the HarvardX research group, that
builds the first of these dictionaries and then makes sure that there are no sets of quasi-identifiers
that have fewer than a user-supplied set of entries in them.
