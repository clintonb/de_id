"""
Takes a database output by buildDB.py and prints the distribution of levels of
education in that database.

The name of the file containing the database should be given as the first argument.
The level of education categories of not specified ('') and 'NA' are merged into a single
category. This could be done with the categories 'none' and 'other', but was not. This
could easily change in the future.

The output prints more meaningful names than the abbreviations used in the database.
