"""
Build a generalization table for country

Takes all of the countries listed in the database to be de-identified, and finds those that
do not have a minimum size. Using a mapping from country to region, builds a table keyed by
country that will have a region with at least the number of records needed to insure
k-anonymity (which is a hard-coded value at the moment, = 50).

Writes out a file with the name supplied as a command line parameter that is the pickle of
the generalization table.

Usage: buildcountrygeneralizer.py databaseFile generalizationFile bin_size {'p'}
where
    databaseFile : name of the file containing the database
    generalizationFile : name of the generalization table file to be written
    bin_size: an integer that is the minimum bin size to trigger generalization
    optional 'p' : useful to see what is happening; will print the generalization file,
    the mapping of countries to counts, and the mapping of regions to counts, on standard
    out.
