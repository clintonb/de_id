"""
Tests whether a file (in .csv format) with each line, consisting of data about a single student,
is anonymous with to a particular level of k.

This program will take a set of fields in each line (hard coded, at the moment) and will check to
insure that there are at least k other lines with the same values for those fields. The fields 
selected should be all those that can be used to re-identify a student. The program will ask for the
data file to test and the level of k to test. 

The program can be run in either full or summary mode. In summary mode, the program will print the
number of lines that would violate the level of k specified. In full mode, all of sets of properties
that would violate the level of k are printed out, so that one can see what properties might need
to be smeared.
